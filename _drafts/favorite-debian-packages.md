the idea is just to list my favorite packages. the ones I install on a new system.

# General

## vim
Older than me and twice as stubborn
## screen
I don't use screen for terminal multiplexing anymore. If I really need multiple terminals I just use vim buffers
## mutt

# Utility

## pv
really good for quick benchmarking and testing
## vmtouch
for controlling and diagnosing fs cache
## nohang
for working on low memory machines

# Network

## mosh
for working on weak/slow wireless
## rclone
## iperf3
## nc
I once emailed the original author of netcat, Hobbit. A decade later I read their blog, it's pretty good!
